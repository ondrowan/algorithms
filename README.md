# Algorithms and data structures implemented in Rust

This repository is a result of my studies of algorithms, data structures and
Rust programming language. Since these topics are new to me, it's possible
there are some mistakes or inefficient implementations. In such case, please
open an issue or submit a pull request.


## Algorithms

### Sorting

* [Bubble sort](src/sorting/bubble.rs)


### Pathfinding

* [Breadth-first search](src/pathfinding/breadth_first.rs)
* [Dijkstra's search](src/pathfinding/dijkstras.rs)
* [Greedy Best-first search](src/pathfinding/greedy_best_first.rs)
* [A* search](src/pathfinding/a_star.rs)

A huge thanks goes to [Amit Patel's exhausting resources](https://www.redblobgames.com/)
on maps, graphs and pathfinding.
